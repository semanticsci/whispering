## whispering

This is project that takes advantage of speech-to-text technology offered by OpenAI https://openai.com/research/whisper

The excellent use case is to leverage that for converting utterances to text.

- ffmpeg_audio_truncate.py - can be used to truncate long utterances into smaller chunks for faster and more focused speech to text conversion
- whisper_to_csv.py - turns utterance into csv file with transcription
